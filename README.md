# Deep Learning in R

This is the repository for D-Labâ€™s six-hour Introduction to Deep Learning in R workshop. Participants should be intermediate R users and have had some prior exposure to the concepts in [R-Machine-Learning](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/R-Machine-Learning).


## Workshop Goals 

In this workshop, we provide an introduction to Deep Learning using TensorFlow and keras in R. First, we will cover the basics of what makes deep learning "deep." Then, we will explore using code to classify images. Along the way, we will build a workflow of a deep learning project. 

## Installation Instructions

We will use RStudio to go through the workshop materials, which requires installation of R, RStudio, and TensorFlow. Complete the following steps if you want to work locally. 

1. Download [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

2. Within the R console, run the following commands 

```
install.packages(c("tensorflow", "keras", "reticulate")) # Pulls in all R dependencies necessary for TensorFlow in R

library(reticulate)

# Set up R with a Python installation it can use
virtualenv_create("r-reticulate", python = install_python()) 

library(keras)
install_keras(envname = "r-reticulate") # Install TensorFlow and Keras python modules
```

After these steps you will have a working Keras and TensorFlow installation. This process will take some time if you decide to download to your local machine. To determine the TensorFlow version installed on your machine, run in the console

```
library(tensorflow)
tf$constant("Hello Tensorflow!")
```

3. Install additional packages required for this workshop

```
install.packages(c("tfhub", "tfdatasets")


## About the UC Berkeley D-Lab

D-Lab works with Berkeley faculty, research staff, and students to advance data-intensive social science and humanities research. Our goal at D-Lab is to provide practical training, staff support, resources, and space to enable you to use R for your own research applications. Our services cater to all skill levels and no programming, statistical, or computer science backgrounds are necessary. We offer these services in the form of workshops, one-to-one consulting, and working groups that cover a variety of research topics, digital tools, and programming languages.
